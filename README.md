## Installation
Please begin by using `npm install` in the root folder. You can call the server to start using `npm start` in the terminal.

## Usage
This project shows the functionality of IndexDB for a progressive web application (PWA). When running a local instance for testing, use Chrome's Web Tools to simulate an "offline" network status. Then submit a new transaction. When bringing the network status to normal, an alert notifies the user that the data was still saved, and is present upon reload.
